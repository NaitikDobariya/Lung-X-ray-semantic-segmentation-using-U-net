## Lung Segmentation Using U-Net

This repository represents an attempt to implement a U-Net architecture for lung segmentation. Using a U-net we shall attempt to do semantic segmentation of lung X-ray pictures.

### About the Project

The project was developed using a Kaggle Jupyter notebook and aimed to implement a U-Net architecture for lung segmentation. The U-Net model architecture is known for its effectiveness in image segmentation tasks, making it suitable for this project's objective.

### Kaggle Notebook and Dataset

The project is based on a Kaggle notebook, which can be accessed via this [Kaggle Notebook Link](https://www.kaggle.com/code/dobariyanaitik/lung-segmentation-using-u-net). The dataset used in the project is the Lung Mask Image dataset, which contains images specifically annotated for lung segmentation tasks.

### Libraries Used

The project leverages various libraries for implementation, including:

- Pandas
- PIL (Python Imaging Library)
- OpenCV (cv2)
- Matplotlib
- NumPy
- TensorFlow
- Keras

### Results

The U-Net model demonstrated promising performance in lung segmentation tasks. While a detailed evaluation is not provided in this README, a demo image showcasing the model's segmentation output is included below:
